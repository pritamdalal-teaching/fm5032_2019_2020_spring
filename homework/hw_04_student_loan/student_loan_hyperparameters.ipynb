    "1. These models can take a long time to run, so I would recommend getting started on this assignment early.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Starting parameters for random forest: `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 10, random_state = 0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the 5-fold cross-validation versions of the following metrics: f1, expected-balance ratio, run-time.  Show some creativity by considering other metrics, or even better making up your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discuss the affect of the hyperparameters in the context of the variance-bias tradeoff.  Which values make the model more or less flexible?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Part of your grade will be based on quality of communication. Your graphs should be readable and labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your code should run without any intervention from the grader.  However, if you create intermediate data-sets that take a long time to run, these should be stored in CSVs so the grader can just read them into your Jupyter Notebook."
